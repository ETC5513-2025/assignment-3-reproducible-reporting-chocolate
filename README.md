* Jingyi Wang

## 📘 Introduction

This project studies water quality at Sydney beaches. We used water and weather data to explore the relationship between rainfall and enterococci levels.


## 🧪 Tools and Packages Used

- RStudio  
- Git & GitHub  
- Quarto (`.qmd`)  
- `renv` (for package management)  
- `knitr`, `tidyverse`, and other R packages  

## 🛠️ Reproducible Setup

I use `renv` to make the project reproducible. Please run:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```
This will install the same packages we used.


## 📌 Project Summary

Our findings show that some beaches are unsafe in Sydney. And heavy rain increases enterococci levels. I recommend avoiding swimming after strong rain.
