## Conclusion

This study shows that some beaches in Sydney, such as Wentworth Falls Lake - Jetty, have very high levels of enterococci. It can be dangerous for public health because swimming in polluted water increases the risk of getting sick, including diarrhea, ear infections and so on. The data also show that rainfall has a strong influence on water quality. After heavy rain, enterococci levels rise a lot. This means that rainfall is a major reason why beach water becomes unsafe. Overall, the results suggest that many beaches are not always safe for swimming, especially after rain.
